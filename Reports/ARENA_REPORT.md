## Introduction

Main goal of this report is to demonstrate the distribution of minions with specific keywords (**Taunt**, **Rush**, **Charge**) per Mana Cost in order to let players know their odds while they are making decisions which are related to random minion summoning. Here is an example:

*Let's suppose that you are holding [Conjurer's Calling](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Conjurer%27s_Calling) and you have 3 minions on board with 4, 7 and 8 mana cost respectively, which minion should you destroy if you are looking to summon a Taunt minion to stay alive?*

After reading this report you will be able to answer the question above easily!
