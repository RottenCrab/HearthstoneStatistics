## Hearthstone Statistics
Since the release of [Rise of Shadows](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/rise-of-shadows/) [Hearhtstone expansion](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/) I have noticed that many players are wondering the odds of getting a Taunt, Rush, Charge or even Deathrattle Minion from Conjurer's Calling Mage Spell. Then, I remembered that back in the day when Evolve (also Unstable Evolution and now Mutate is introduced to the Standard Format) was a Standard Card players were facing the same issue. Knowing the chances of summoning a random minion with a certain keyword on each Mana Cost sometimes may win you the game.

I decided to make a Project to demonstrate Statistics like these (using simple plots) to help players make decisions when the time comes. So, the main purpose of this very project is to help players knowing their chances of getting what they want when they are using cards like Evolve, Devolve, Unstable Evolution, Mutate and Conjurer's Calling.

## Features

#### Conjurer's Calling Statistics
Since [Conjurer's Calling](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Conjurer%27s_Calling) is currently used in Standard Format with from a decent perchentage of players, I decided to started working on it first.

So far you can find the following plots [here](https://github.com/RottenCrab/HearthstoneStatistics/tree/master/Plots):
* Average Stats for summoned minions per Mana Cost for Conjurer's Calling 
* Taunt Probability for summoned minions per Mana Cost for Conjurer's Calling

Soon I will be making plots for more statistcs over Conjurer's Calling. I already have on the works the following plots:
* Rush Probability for summoned minions per Mana Cost for Conjurer's Calling
* Charge Probability for summoned minions per Mana Cost for Conjurer's Calling
* Deathrattle Probability for summoned minions per Mana Cost for Conjurer's Calling
* Best possible minion outcome for Conjurer's Calling per Mana Cost
* Worst possivle minion outcome for Conjurer's Calling per Mana Cost

**NOTE**: In this project you can find both statistics about Standard and Wild Format.

#### Future Card Statistics

Soon, I will upload statistical plots for the following cards:
* [Evolve](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Evolve)
* [Unstable Evolution](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Unstable_Evolution)
* [Devolve](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Devolve)
* [Mutate](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Mutate)

 Future goal is to present statistcs about cards with **Discover** Keyword
