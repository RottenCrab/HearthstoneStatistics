# Author's Note

**From now on (6 August 2019) I stopped supporting this Repository (due to its bad coding aspect) and I will keep uploading new content about Hearthstone Statistics and Plots at this Repository: [HearthVizualizer](https://github.com/RottenCrab/HearthVizualizer). Make sure you check it out! Thank you!**

## Hearthstone Statistics
Since the release of [Rise of Shadows](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/expansions-adventures/rise-of-shadows/) [Hearhtstone expansion](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/) I have noticed that many players are wondering the odds of getting a Taunt, Rush, Charge or even Deathrattle Minion from Conjurer's Calling Mage Spell. Then, I remembered that back in the day when Evolve (also Unstable Evolution and now Mutate is introduced to the Standard Format) was a Standard Card players were facing the same issue. Knowing the chances of summoning a random minion with a certain keyword on each Mana Cost sometimes may win you the game.

I decided to create this Project to demonstrate Statistics like these (using simple plots) to help players make decisions when the time comes. So, the main purpose of this very repository is to help players knowing their chances of getting what they want when they are using cards like Evolve, Devolve, Unstable Evolution, Mutate and Conjurer's Calling.

## How to Use

In this Repository you can find Reports, Plots and Spreadsheets which contain information about the distribution of minions per Mana Cost (from 0 Mana Cost up to 12 Mana Cost, since 20 and 25 Mana Cost cards cannot be generated through any current cards) in both **Standard** and **Wild** Format which are easy to understand. Then you can utilize those resources in order to be aware of:
 
* Average Minion Stats per Mana Cost (what you stats you should expect when you summon a random minion of a certain Mana Cost)
* Total Collectible Minions per Mana Cost
* Total **Taunt** Minions per Mana Cost
* Total **Rush** Minions per Mana Cost
* Total **Charge** Minions per Mana Cost
* **Taunt** Probability per Mana Cost
* **Rush** Probability per Mana Cost
* **Charge** Probability per Mana Cost
* Total available Minions in Standard Format (Collectible only)
* Total available Minions in Wild Format (Collectible only)

Having all information mentioned above can help you play your outs better when it comes to decision making based on Random Minion Summoning or Transformation Effects. Here are some cards which are related to Radom Minion Summoning and Transformation:
